ERIC PARAPINI

This is a set of sql work that I am doing for my HINF201 Database project.
Most of the stuff here contains generation scripts to have a large set of 
randomly generated dummy data. This is so that the project application can look
nice when it is simulated in the class use.

DESCRIPTION:
This project is meeting the needs of a small fictional BC-based Canadian general
practice clinic that consists of a small set of practicing physicians. 

FEATURES:
- Patient Tracking    - Keeps track of basic patient info
- Patient Encounters  - Keeps track of every encounter the patient has made
- ICD-10-CA           - Contains all the ICD-10-CA Codes sent by CIHI
- Billing             - Contains the list of fees approved by MSC

TOOLS:
The software is non-negiotable. I am assigned to only develop on Oracle 10g
Express. And must also develop an application frontend using all of the

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is recommended to run the scripts in the order that they are listed in the contents section.

CONTENTS
start.sql                 - Initializes the database
DateInsertScript{0,1,2,3} - Inserts every day from Jan/1st/1972 - Dec/31/2014
ICD10CAScript{0,1,2}      - Inserts a large portion of ICD-10-CA by CIHI
Populate                  - Inserts a set of doctors and patients + info
cleanup                   - Drops all tables in the order of dependencies

UTILITY DIRECTORIES
./billing/  - Contains scripts and text for making the encounters table
./date/     - Contains scripts to make the DateInsertScript.sql
./icd10CA/  - Contains scripts and text for the ICD-10-CA Table
./people/   - Contains scripts and text to make the doctors and patients


TODO:
Need to integrate the billing script into the people and doctor one so that
I can make dummy events that fill up how much a doctor should be payed for the
month (or day, or whatever)
