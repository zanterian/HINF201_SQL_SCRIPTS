This is a set of sql work that I am doing for my HINF201 Database project.
Most of the stuff here contains generation scripts to have a large set of 
randomly generated dummy data. This is so that the project application can look
nice when it is simulated in the class use.

DESCRIPTION:
This project is meeting the needs of a small fictional BC-based Canadian general
practice clinic that consists of a small set of practicing physicians. 

FEATURES:
- Patient Tracking    - Keeps track of basic patient info
- Patient Encounters  - Keeps track of every encounter the patient has made
- ICD-10-CA           - Contains all the ICD-10-CA Codes sent by CIHI
- Billing             - Contains the list of fees approved by MSC

TOOLS:
The software is non-negiotable. I am assigned to only develop on Oracle 10g
Express. And must also develop an application frontend using only the tools that
Oracle 10g provides me

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is recommended to run the scripts in the order that they are listed in the contents section.
Aside from the one that cleans up the database of course.

CONTENTS
Start.sql                 - Initializes the database and uses procedure
Fill_Database.sql         - Populates the database with all of the people
ICD10CAScript{0,1,2}      - Inserts a large portion of ICD-10-CA by CIHI
Cleanup.sql               - Drops all tables in the order of dependencies

UTILITY DIRECTORIES
./icd10CA/             - Contains scripts and text for the ICD-10-CA Table
./encounters/          - Contains scripts for encounter extraction
./people_and_events/   - Creates Patients, Doctors, Events, and Visits


IN PROGRESS:
Nothing. This should be a relitively stable set of code at this point.`
