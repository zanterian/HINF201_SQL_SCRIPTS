This is a set of sql work that I am doing for my HINF201 Database project. 
I wanted to have some version control on what I did (especially after that
especially nasty accidental deletion surprise!)

It is recommended to run the scripts in the order that they are listed in the contents section.

CONTENTS
start.sql 					- Initializes the database
DateInsertScript{0,1,2,3} 	- Inserts every day from Jan/1st/1972 - Dec/31/2014
ICD10CAScript{0,1,2} 		- Inserts a large portion of ICD-10-CA by CIHI
Populate					- Inserts a set of doctors and patients + info
cleanup						- Drops all tables in the order of dependencies

UTILITY DIRECTORIES
./billing/ 	- Contains scripts and text for making the encounters table
./date/ 	- Contains scripts to make the DateInsertScript.sql
./icd10CA/	- Contains scripts and text for the ICD-10-CA Table
./people/	- Contains scripts and text to make the doctors and patients
