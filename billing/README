This makes the billing tables needed for the "Encounter" table in the database.

PracticeGuidelines is a text dump of the published billing payments by BC Ministry of health. 
The site can be found: http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/msp/infoprac/physbilling/payschedule/index.html
I took the guidelines from the "General Practice" PDF, as that was the most relevent

sample use:
cat <File> | ./sift.pl | ./2encounter.pl > <Destination>
