General Practice Group Medical Visit
A Group Medical Visit provides 1:1 patient care in a group setting. Group Medical Visits are an effective way of leveraging existing resources; simultaneously improving quality of care and health outcomes, increasing patient access to care and reducing costs. Group Medical Visits can offer patients an additional health care choice, provide them support from other patients and improve the patient-physician interaction. Physicians can also benefit by reducing the need to repeat the same information many times and free up time for other patients. Appropriate patient privacy is always maintained and typically these benefits result in improved satisfaction for both patients and physicians.
The Group Medical Visit is not appropriate for advice relating to a single patient. It applies only when all members of the group are receiving medically required treatment (i.e. each member of the group is a patient). The GP Group Medical Visits are not intended for activities related to attempting to persuade a patient to alter diet or other lifestyle behavioural patterns other than in the context of the individual medical condition

. Complex Care Fees
The Complex Care Management Fee was developed to compensate GPs for the management of complex patients who have chronic conditions from a least 2 of the 8 categories listed below. Providing the Complex Care planning visit and billing for the development of a care plan allows access to 5 telephone/e-mail fees (G14079) during the following 18 months.
These items are payable only to the General Practitioner who accepts the role of being Most Responsible for the longitudinal, coordinated care of that patient; by billing this fee the practitioner accepts that responsibility for the ensuing calendar year.
The Most Responsible General Practitioner may bill this fee when providing care only to community patients; i.e. residing in their homes or in assisted living with two or more of the following chronic conditions:
1)
Diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2)
2)
Chronic Kidney Disease

a) PHQ9, Beck Inventory, Ham-D for depression;
b) MMSE for cognitive impairment;
c) MDQ for bipolar illness;
